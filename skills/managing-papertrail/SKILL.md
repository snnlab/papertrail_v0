description: Use when working in a research repository initialized for the papertrail workflow (plans/master-plan.md exists AND the repo's CLAUDE.md contains the papertrail marker) — when a session starts there, when the student asks to adopt the workflow mid-session after exploratory work has begun, when executing analysis or data work, when a decision point arises with the student, when work deviates from an execution plan, or when the student mentions the master plan, an execution plan, or the decision log. Not for software project planning, and not for repositories without both markers.

# Managing PaperTrail

## Overview

Dual-tracking: **the student plans and decides; you carry the bookkeeping.** The project keeps a lightweight master plan (a roadmap with a components tracker), one versioned execution plan per component, and an append-only decision log. Your job is to keep those three artifacts truthful without the student having to think about them.

Artifacts are organized around **the research project and its questions**: the master plan carries numbered research questions (RQ1, RQ2, …) and every component serves one or more of them (the Serves column; `—` for genuine infrastructure). Components are research activities, never a history of repository actions — what exists in the repo informs status, never structure.

## When NOT to use (hard gate)

This skill applies only when **both** opt-in markers exist:

1. `plans/master-plan.md` containing `<!-- papertrail:master-plan -->`
2. The repo's `CLAUDE.md` containing `<!-- papertrail:start -->`

If either is absent, this workflow does not apply. Stay silent about it, never create `plans/` uninvited, and never suggest initializing unless the student asks. A stray copied `master-plan.md` without the CLAUDE.md marker does not count as opt-in. For software implementation plans, use superpowers writing-plans instead.

## Core pattern

**Session start.** Read `plans/master-plan.md`, then the latest version of the execution plan for whichever component the work touches (`plans/execution/<NN-slug>/`, highest `vN.md`).

**Model nudge (execution).** If the project has `plans/model-profile.md`, execution work honors its `execute` row: run `python3 <this skill's directory>/scripts/models.py stage execute` once at the start of execution work. Empty output → say nothing (relay any stderr warning once — `/papertrail:models` fixes a malformed row). In the `/papertrail:execute` prompt, pre-select that row only when the stage yields a usable non-`inherit` row; on any non-`inherit` selection print the one-line `/model` nudge and wait for the switch — never compare against your own identity. Outside that prompt, the nudge stays advisory and never repeats in a session.

**Mid-session adoption.** The workflow can be adopted mid-session, after exploratory work has begun (`/papertrail:init` works either way). What the session already established feeds the plan — context, research questions, goals, scope reasons — never the log. The log starts at the master plan's `Initialized:` timestamp; nothing before it is loggable or counts as a deviation.

**During work.**
- Surface interpretive choices (variable selection, case exclusions, coding rules, model specification) to the student *before* acting. Do not decide research questions, analytical choices, or interpretation on the student's behalf.
- Append to `plans/decision-log.md` **as decisions happen** — when you ask a clarifying question, when the student sets or changes scope, when you make a non-trivial interpretive call (flag it), or when a surprising result changes what happens next. Use the entry format in `templates/decision-log.md`, with a real timestamp (`date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"`). If unsure whether to log: log it.
- If work is about to exceed what the current plan covers, pause and say so. Either the student rescopes the task, or you draft a new plan version. Do not drift.

**After execution work.**
- Update the component's row in the master plan tracker (status + one-line outcome) when there is real evidence of progress (outputs on disk, commits), and update `Last updated:`.
- If execution deviated materially from the plan, propose `v<N+1>.md` with a `Supersedes` line stating what changed and why. `/papertrail:sync` records the confirmed amendment. Re-execution recommits it through a sign session first.
- Results capture runs automatically at the end of the execution loop (and from `/papertrail:sync` for out-of-loop work) — in the loop the agent curates the bundle (labeled `curatedBy: agent`) and verification = the mechanical validation pass plus the student's standing Reopen right; in a manual `/sync` capture the per-component interview still runs. Either way capture stays visible and evidence-based, never a silent bulk write.
- `/papertrail:sync` is the manual recovery checkpoint; the primary loop is plan → draft review → execute gate → tail. Use sync's late-capture protocol when logging was missed outside the loop.

**Results bundles.** `plans/execution/<NN-slug>/results/rN/` holds an immutable snapshot of what an analysis produced: `manifest.json` (plan version, provenance planned|retrofit, trigger, metrics, artifacts with sha256 sources and producing scripts — a table artifact carries its typeset .png as `file` plus `tex`/`data` sources, and the board displays the render and links the sources — a `validation` block: an independent subagent's plan-vs-execution audit written at capture, `conforms` / `conforms-with-amendments` / `deviations-found` / `unverifiable`, or `not-applicable`/`skipped`; advisory, never a gate; and a sealed mechanical `score` block (F·A·I — fidelity · attainment · integrity, 0–3 each, derived at finalize from the validation verdicts and integrity checks; diagnostic, never a gate)), `report.md` (brief, cites artifacts by id, honest about misses), `validation.md` (the readable audit, when one ran), `artifacts/` (copies; >5 MB recorded by path+checksum only), and `scripts/` (the code that ran). Old bundles may also contain a legacy `verdict.json`; the board reads it, but v0.20 workflows never create or change it. Capture always goes through `scripts/results.py` staging (`stage`/`copy`/`finalize`); direct writes into `rN/` are hook-denied. Validation defines the bundle's standing state. Set the tracker to `done (validated)` when validation conforms, `done (unvalidated)` when it is skipped or unverifiable, and `done (retrofit)` for retrofit work. A fix is always a NEW bundle (`trigger: redo-after-review`), never an edit. Backfilling is legitimate: `/papertrail:results` with no argument reconciles components whose plans ran ahead of their results record, one interview at a time; plan-governed work captured after the fact carries `late: true` in the manifest (the results analogue of the log's late-captured label — the script snapshot shows the code as of capture, not necessarily as of the run). A bundle's generated report (`plans/reports/<NN-slug>-rN-report.md`, one per bundle) is a derived document keyed 1:1 to the bundle; its first line is an `pt-report` JSON marker recording component/bundle/plan/validation/date.

## Conventions

- **Versions are immutable and mechanically enforced.** `v1.md, v2.md, ...` are never overwritten or edited. The PreToolUse hook matches Claude's Write and Edit tools in initialized projects. It admits a new canonical version through a valid sign-session ticket or through `/sync`'s amendment path. Use `/papertrail:sign` for one or many pending drafts. A direct canonical Write opens the same slim sign view through the hook transport. A denial or timeout preserves the proposal as `.draft-vN.md` for recovery. Headless and CI sessions may set `PAPERTRAIL_NO_GATE=1`; this explicit bypass leaves a stderr trace. Bash-mediated writes are also outside the hook matcher. These are documented enforcement boundaries, so do not claim that the hook covers other write paths. Deviations are recorded, never hidden.
- **The log is append-only and real-time.** Never backfill at the end of a session. Late captures happen only via `/papertrail:sync` and carry the `(late-captured at sync)` label. Pre-adoption decisions go in `plans/history.md`, never the log.
- **Plan provenance.** A plan is prospective by default. Work adopted after it was done gets a full plan carrying `Provenance: retrospective — covers <range>` plus a `Sources` section — an honest label, not a lesser plan, judged by the same five-channel rubric. Provenance is not scored: a plan committed after its work, or a retrospective whose Sources do not resolve, is reported as a non-scored **integrity flag** (`uncommitted` / `unsupported-sources` / `unrecorded-deviation`) beside the score, never a lower channel. `/papertrail:adopt` drafts retrospective plans in bulk and signs them in one sign session.
- **Numbers are stable identifiers.** A component's `#` and slug are assigned once and never change, move, or get reused — the execution plan and any finalized results bundle are addressed by that slug forever. Work sequence is the **table row order**; reorder rows, never renumber. A late-adopted component shows its true place by moving its row.
- **Pre-adoption history is a record, not the log.** Decisions predating `Initialized:` go in `plans/history.md`: reconstructed, evidence-cited, date-granularity, appendable anytime but scoped strictly to pre-adoption events. The decision log stays real-time; `history.md` never fabricates a clock time.
- **Retrospective work is retrofit, never planned.** A results bundle backfilled under a retrospective plan is `provenance: retrofit` (the plan links it via `planVersion` without claiming to have governed it). Stamping `planned` is the results-layer version of undeclared retrospection — and it is permanent.
- **Renewal (v0.10).** When the project changes direction, `/papertrail:renew` archives the master plan to `plans/archive/master-plan-<date>.md` (immutable — hook-enforced), writes a fresh one (new context and RQs; carried rows keep their numbers, slugs, and dirs; new components take next-available numbers across all archives), preserves `Initialized:` unchanged (the honesty cutoff never moves), adds a `Renewed:` line and a `Foundations` section, and keeps ONE continuous decision log — the renewal is an entry, not a new log. Pre-renewal components stay browsable on the board (Archive view, quiet badges) and are never flagged as drift.
- **Output conventions (v0.10).** CLAUDE.md rule 7 names the target journal; analysis deliverables are journal-ready figures (vector PDF + PNG) and typeset tables (.png + .tex) — a CSV of estimates is an intermediate, never the deliverable or the board display.
- **Model profiles (v0.14).** `plans/model-profile.md` maps stages to models: interactive stages get a one-line nudge (you decide), delegated stages run in generated `pt-*` project agents pinning model + effort (best-effort — platform overrides win). No profile → zero behavior change. Hand-edits are validated by `/papertrail:models`, which regenerates the agents; it refuses to overwrite a same-named agent the student owns.
- **The master plan stays light.** One line of outcome per component; detail lives in execution plans and the log. Do not let sync bloat it.
- **The plan is not a preregistration — it is a contract with a built-in amendment process.** A recorded revision is an amendment: legitimate, expected. A silent deviation is a breach. Preregistration freezes the contract; this workflow keeps it amendable and treats only undisclosed change as deviation.
- **Canonical trailers record status.** A canonical execution plan ends with either `Signed off:` after a student sign decision or `Amendment recorded,` after `/sync` records a deviation. Re-execution of an amendment requires a signed re-commitment version.
- **Native plan mode.** If the student uses Claude Code's plan mode anyway, copy the approved plan into the component's next version slot so the repo record stays complete.
- **Commits.** After plan versions, log milestones, or tracker changes, suggest a short commit (e.g., `plan: 02-analysis v2 — switched to multilevel after ICC check`). Do not commit without the student's go-ahead.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/papertrail:init` | Opt a project in (creates the artifacts) |
| `/papertrail:adopt` | Retrospectively decompose done work into components with retrospective plans; reconstruct pre-adoption history |
| `/papertrail:renew` | Archive the master plan, write a fresh one for a new direction; carry accomplishments forward |
| `/papertrail:plan` | Scope next component, author its execution plan |
| `/papertrail:execute` | One question, then the loop: execute, capture, validate, report, next steps |
| `/papertrail:sync` | Manual recovery checkpoint: out-of-loop tracker, log, and revisions |
| `/papertrail:results` | Capture a results bundle (report, artifacts, scripts, metrics); no argument = reconcile/backfill walk; `--adopt` for pre-existing outputs |
| `/papertrail:report` | Generate a shareable per-bundle report (md + pdf/docx via pandoc) into `plans/reports/`; offered at capture end by /results; board Reports tab renders it |
| `/papertrail:review` | Score the plan against the five-channel rubric (`references/plan-rubric.md`): a profile, the biggest leak, and the forks to fix |
| `/papertrail:models` | View or edit the per-stage model profile; regenerate the `pt-*` review agents |
| `/papertrail:board` | Browser board: tracker (with drift flags), plans + diffs (with each version's five-channel score in the header), results, reports, timeline; live control surface (stable bookmarkable port) that closes on action and reopens on demand, with approve/request-changes/review actions, one-click agent review (Codex/Gemini/subagent panel), or static export |

Judgment criteria live in `references/`: `plan-rubric.md` (quality scoring), `split-criteria.md` (when a plan is too big), `explore-before-planning.md` (bounded data exploration before authoring), `planning-doctrine.md` (the authoring standard behind `/plan`).

## Common mistakes

- **Backfilling the log** to look thorough. A reconstructed log is worse than a sparse one.
- **Editing an existing version** "to fix a typo." Versions are evidence; new version or nothing.
- **Deciding for the student** because the choice seems obvious. Obvious choices are cheap to confirm and expensive to unwind.
- **Updating the tracker without evidence.** Status changes follow artifacts (outputs, commits), not optimism.
- **Letting exploration become analysis.** Bounded exploration informs a plan; results worth keeping belong under a signed or recorded plan.
- **Padding a results bundle.** Zero qualifying artifacts is a legitimate capture outcome; report it and stop. Never guess a producing script — `producedBy: null` beats a fabricated provenance.
- **Editing a finalized bundle** to "fix" a figure. The fix is a re-run captured as the next `rN`; the captured record stays reproducible.
