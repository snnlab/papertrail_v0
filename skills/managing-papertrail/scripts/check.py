"""papertrail: check for new instructor feedback on the classroom server.

Split out of submit.py (which used to check for comments as a side effect of
every submission) so submission and comment-checking are two separate,
independently runnable actions — /papertrail:submit sends, /papertrail:check
looks for feedback, either any time.

Fetches every comment across ALL of the student's own past submissions
(GET /api/my-comments, one call, server-side — never trusts local
bookkeeping alone for which submissions exist), then routes anything not
already seen through the SAME board-feedback document pipeline
board.py's --pull already uses for the single-project hosted board:
assemble_hosted_document -> inspect_feedback_document (prints a document
whose ```json board-feedback``` fence has "mode": "hosted" — the student's
own board.md step 5 routing then discusses/acts on it exactly like any other
collaborator feedback).

Anchored comments (a quote on a plan version, the tracker, or a results
report) are ALSO written as a `--seed-annotations` file so /papertrail:check
can reopen the local board with the instructor's comments painted in place,
at their original anchors — the student reads the instructor's exact words
in context, not a relayed summary. The text document above is still produced
for every comment and stays the authoritative, untrusted-DATA routing path;
the seed file is a viewing aid layered on top.

Stdlib only, Python 3.9+. Exit codes: 0 always (a comment-check failure is
never fatal to the surrounding session — same "fail open" spirit as
submit.py's own git_log_excerpt/fetch_comments); 1 only for a genuine usage
error (no classroom server configured yet).
